Lab 1:
1. to run diky fuller test to see if it is stationary
2. remove trend
3. split data into test and training, it is time series
4. use past 10 values for prediction
	first of all one layer with 100 epchocs use sgd optimizer, accuracy metric, dont forget to specify the validation data
5. compare the loss and accurancy for test set and for training set
6. when you see overfiting and explain
when there is vanishing and exploding in the graiend, take a look at the plot, look at the accuracy and the loss
7. make predictions
8. play around with the model:
	500 epochs, use plots to conclude
	try 2,3,4 layers
	tell which models overfit
	use regularization methods: dropout, ... change percents, use autoregularization and ry to not overfit
	
	
	hetero - take log
	trend - take diff
	
undo the differencing when creating the predictions (we only train on the difference)
not necessary to undo the log
